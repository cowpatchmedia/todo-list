To do list for Odin project. 

This was a very difficult project, I would say the most difficult project so far. the logic for nesting tasks within
projects and linking all button listeners, then making sure the dom elements were correctly updated was very 
confusing. 

I kept the maroon and cream theme which gives nice pop to the application. 

Using local storage is the first time any of my apps have had persistence which is a cool feature. 

This project shows why prototyping, coding in plain language and the idea of building a house from the inside out
is such a good idea to remember when starting. With better planning of application logic, the todo list could have 
been much cleaner and easier to understand.
